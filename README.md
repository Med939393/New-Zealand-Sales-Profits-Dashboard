ðŸŽ¼ Musician of SQL: New Zealand Sales & Profits Dashboard
Welcome to my full-stack data analytics project, where SQL meets storytelling and Power BI becomes a stage for insight. This project is a tribute to the harmony between logic and creativityâ€”built from raw data, refined through SQL, and visualized in a dynamic dashboard.

Focus Areas: Time-based analysis, segmentation logic, KPI tracking, and dashboard design

ðŸ§  SQL Highlights
Cleaned and deduplicated data using ROW_NUMBER() and CTEs

Calculated moving totals and previous period comparisons with LAG() and SUM OVER()

Created segmentation logic to classify performance as Increase, Decrease, or No Change

Published a clean view (new_sales2) for seamless integration with Power BI

ðŸ“ˆ Power BI Dashboard Features

ðŸŽ¨ Design Philosophy
This dashboard isnâ€™t just functionalâ€”itâ€™s expressive. From the New Zealand flag to the clean layout and color-coded visuals, every element is designed to make data feel intuitive, engaging, and alive.
